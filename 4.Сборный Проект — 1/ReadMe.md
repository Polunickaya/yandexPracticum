# Сборный проект

Вы работаете в интернет-магазине «Стримчик», который продаёт по всему миру компьютерные игры. Из открытых источников доступны исторические данные о продажах игр, оценки пользователей и экспертов, жанры и платформы (например, Xbox или PlayStation). Вам нужно выявить определяющие успешность игры закономерности. Это позволит сделать ставку на потенциально популярный продукт и спланировать рекламные кампании.

Перед вами данные до 2016 года. Представим, что сейчас декабрь 2016 г., и вы планируете кампанию на 2017-й. Нужно отработать принцип работы с данными. Неважно, прогнозируете ли вы продажи на 2017 год по данным 2016-го или же 2027-й — по данным 2026 года.

В наборе данных попадается аббревиатура ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) — это ассоциация, определяющая возрастной рейтинг компьютерных игр. ESRB оценивает игровой контент и присваивает ему подходящую возрастную категорию, например, «Для взрослых», «Для детей младшего возраста» или «Для подростков».

**Задача** — выявить определяющие успешность игры закономерности.

**Ход исследования**

Данные получим из файла:
- /datasets/games.csv.

О качестве данных ничего не известно. Поэтому перед проверкой гипотез понадобится обзор данных.  

Таким образом, исследование пройдёт в шесть этапов:
 1. Изучение данных.
 2. Предобработка данных.
 3. Исследовательский анализ данных.
 4. Составление портрета пользователя каждого региона
 5. Проверка гипотез.
 6. Вывод.

### Вывод

После первого ознакомления с данными видим несоответствие типов данных в столбце `Year_of_Release` и `User_Score`, также видим неправильный стиль названия стобцов и пропуски, в столбцах `Critic_Score` и `Rating` в большом количестве. 
С причиной их возникновения будем разбираться на следующих этапах.

Описание данных:

- `Name` — название игры
- `Platform` — платформа
- `Year_of_Release` — год выпуска
- `Genre` — жанр игры
- `NA_sales` — продажи в Северной Америке (миллионы проданных копий)
- `EU_sales` — продажи в Европе (миллионы проданных копий)
- `JP_sales` — продажи в Японии (миллионы проданных копий)
- `Other_sales` — продажи в других странах (миллионы проданных копий)
- `Critic_Score` — оценка критиков (максимум 100)
- `User_Score` — оценка пользователей (максимум 10)
- `Rating` — рейтинг от организации ESRB (англ. Entertainment Software Rating Board). Эта ассоциация определяет рейтинг компьютерных игр и присваивает им подходящую возрастную категорию.

Из описания проекта знаем, что данные за 2016 год могут быть неполными.

## Предобработка данных 

Сначала приведем названия столбцов к нижнему регистру.


```python
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower() #приводим названия столбцов к нижнему регистру 
df.columns #проверка
```




    Index(['name', 'platform', 'year_of_release', 'genre', 'na_sales', 'eu_sales',
           'jp_sales', 'other_sales', 'critic_score', 'user_score', 'rating'],
          dtype='object')



Далее разберемся с пропусками и проверим наличие дубликатов. 


```python
df.isna().sum() #количество пропусков
```




    name                  2
    platform              0
    year_of_release     269
    genre                 2
    na_sales              0
    eu_sales              0
    jp_sales              0
    other_sales           0
    critic_score       8578
    user_score         6701
    rating             6766
    dtype: int64




```python
df.isna().mean() #доля пропусков
```




    name               0.000120
    platform           0.000000
    year_of_release    0.016093
    genre              0.000120
    na_sales           0.000000
    eu_sales           0.000000
    jp_sales           0.000000
    other_sales        0.000000
    critic_score       0.513192
    user_score         0.400897
    rating             0.404786
    dtype: float64




```python
df.duplicated().sum() #проверяем дубликаты
```




    0



Явных дубликатов в данных не обнаружено.

Для начала посмотрим на пропуски в столбце `name`.


```python
display(df.query('name.isna()')) #смотрим на пропуски в столбце name
```

Видим, что пропуски в столбце `name` совпадают со столбцом `genre`, заполнить их не сможем поэтому примем решение их удалить. Данные игры были выпущены в 1993 году, так что вряд ли удаление этих строк можем повлиять на дальнейший анализ. 


```python
df.drop(index = [659, 14244],axis = 0, inplace = True) #удаляем строки с пропусками
```

Посмотрим на пропуски в столбце `year_of_release`.


```python
display(df.query('year_of_release.isna()')) #смотрим на пропуски в столбце year_of_release

Какой-то явной взаимосвязи не обнаружено, пропуски в столбце `year_of_release` занимают всего 1,6%, но заполнить мы их не можем, поэтому примем решение их тоже удалить. 


```python
df.dropna(subset=['year_of_release'], inplace = True) 
#удаляем строки с пропусками в столбце year_of_release
```

Пропуски в столбце `rating` занимают более чем 40% всех данных. Так как у нас данные представлены начиная с 1980 года, а ассоциация ESRB появилась только в 1994 году, пропуски в столбце `rating` вполне объяснимы. Однако, в дальнейшем анализе нам понадобится  оценивать влияние рейтинга ESRB на продажи в каждом регионе. Чтобы игры без рейтинга не оказались полностью исключенными из анализа, заменим пропуски на "no_rating".


```python
df['rating'] = df['rating'].fillna('no_rating') #заполняем пропуски значением no_rating
```

Видим, что пропуски в столбцах `critic_score` и `user_score` представлены в большом количестве. Оценки критиков и пользователей носят неоднозначный характер, возможно начиная с 1980 года еще не было правила оценивать игры и данная процедура появилась сильно позже, с развитием игровой индустрии. Но также вероятно, что данные были не заполнены случайно.

В любом случае, всякое заполнение пропусков приведет к искажению данных, поэтому оставим их нетронутыми. 

Далее поменяем тип данных в столбцах `year_of_release` и `critic_score` на Int, `user_score` на Float.


```python
df['year_of_release'] = df['year_of_release'].astype('Int64') #меняем тип данных 
df['critic_score'] = df['critic_score'].astype('Int64') #меняем тип данных 
```

В столбце `user_score` присутствует аббревиатура 'tbd', что означает 'to be determined', то есть 'Подлежит определению'. Заменим 'tbd' на NaN и преобразуем тип данных в столбце на float. 


```python
df['user_score'] = df['user_score'].replace("tbd", np.NaN).astype('float64') #меняем тип данных 
```


```python
df.info() # проверяем результат исправления типов данных
```

```python
df['sum_sales'] = df['na_sales'] + df['eu_sales'] + df['jp_sales'] + df['other_sales'] 
#добавляем столбец с суммарными продажами во всех регионах
```

### Вывод

Мы исправили названия столбцов, удалили пропуски в столбцах `name`, `genre` и `year_of_release`, заполнили пропуски в столбце `rating` на "no_rating",
преобразовали тип данных в столбцах `user_score`, `critic_score` и `year_of_release`, и добавили новый столбец `sum_sales` с суммарными продажами во всех регионах.

## Исследовательский анализ данных

### Посмотрим, сколько игр выпускалось в разные годы


```python
df.groupby(['year_of_release'])['name'].count().plot.bar(figsize=(10,8)) 
#строим гистограмму кол-ва выпускаемых игр по годам
plt.title('Количество выпускаемых игр по годам')
plt.legend(['Количество игр'])
plt.xlabel('Года')
plt.ylabel('Количество')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](picture/output_34_0.png)
    


Видим явную тенденцию роста количества выпускаемых игр начиная с 1994 года, и более резкий рост начиная с 2000 года.

Также прослеживается не менее резкий спад с 2010 года вплоть до 2012 года, после которого 
количество выпускаемых игр в год примерно на одном уровне. Столь резкое падение может быть обусловлено стремительным развитием мобильных приложений на платформах iOS и Android, а также некий переход на онлайн игры.

### Посмотрим, как менялись продажи по платформам. Выберите платформы с наибольшими суммарными продажами и постройте распределение по годам. За какой характерный срок появляются новые и исчезают старые платформы?

Так как нам нужно выявить потенциально популярный продукт и спланировать рекламные кампании на 2017 год, будем брать во внимание только данные с 2012 по 2016 год. Анализировать предшествующие года будет не информативно. 


```python
df_year = df[df['year_of_release'] >= 2012] #делаем срез данных начиная с 2012 года
```


```python
df_year.groupby(['platform'])['sum_sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).to_frame().head(10).reset_index()
```

На графике явно наблюдаем самые "продаваемые" платформы, это PS4, PS3, X360, 3DS и XOne. Далее наблюдаем заметный спад в продажах. Поэтому остановимся на этих пяти платформах для дальнейшего анализа. 

Построим распределение по годам для платформ с наибольшими суммарными продажами.


```python
df_platform = df_year[df_year['platform'].isin(['PS4', 'PS3', 'X360', '3DS','XOne'])] 
#делаем срез данных, включающий только платформы PS4, PS3, X360, 3DS и XOne
```


```python
fig = px.bar(df_platform, x='year_of_release', y='sum_sales', color='platform', barmode='group')
#строим график распределения по годам для платформ с наибольшими суммарными продажами
fig.update_layout(
    title_text='Распределение по годам для платформ с наибольшими суммарными продажами', 
    xaxis_title_text='Года', 
    yaxis_title_text='Общие продажи'
)
```

По графику видим, что для каждой платформы характерно примерно 5 лет прибывания на рынке.
 - PS3 с 2012 по 2016, ровно 5 лет, пик продаж приходится на 2013 год.
 - X360 с 2012 по 2016 (5 лет), пик продаж приходится на 2012 год. 
 - 3DS с 2012 по 2016 (5 лет), пик продаж приходится на 2013 год. 
 - PS4 с 2013 - 2016 (4 года), пик продаж приходится на 2015 г
 - XOne с 2013 - 2016 (4 года), пик продаж приходится на 2015 г
 
Можем отметить двух явных лидеров по суммарным продажам PS3 и PS4, также видно, как постепенно PS4 смещает с рынка PS3. Еще можем отметить достаточно хорошие продажи у платформы X360, которая на протяжении всего рассматриваемого периода идет почти "ногу в ногу" с PS3. 

### Какие платформы лидируют по продажам, растут или падают? Выберите несколько потенциально прибыльных платформ.

На основании предыдущих выводов отфильтруем наши данные, будем рассматривать данные начиная с 2012 года.

df= df[df['year_of_release'] >= 2012] #делаем фильтр исходной таблицы

По графику видно, что на конец 2016 года лидируют по продажам три платформы:
- PS4
- Xone
- 3DS

Но в то же время даже продажи этих трех платформ все равно падают. Из описания проекта мы знаем, что за 2016 год данные предствалены не полные, так что судить о продажах в 2016 году будет некорректно. 

### Постройте график «ящик с усами» по глобальным продажам игр в разбивке по платформам. Опишите результат

На предыдущем шаге мы выявили три потенциально прибыльные платформы PS4, Xone и 3DS.
Построим ящик с усами для указаных платформ. 


```python
df_top_platform = df_year[df_year['platform'].isin(['PS4', 'XOne', '3DS'])] 
```


```python
fig = px.box(df_top_platform, x='platform', y='sum_sales', color='platform')
#строим график распределения по годам для платформ с наибольшими суммарными продажами
fig.update_layout(
    title_text='Продажи по самым прибыльным платформам', 
    xaxis_title_text='Платформы', 
    yaxis_title_text='Общие продажи', 
    yaxis=dict(range=[0,1])
)
```

Практически на одном уровне продажи у XOne и PS4, значительно отстает среди лидеров платформа 3DS.

### Посмотрите, как влияют на продажи внутри одной популярной платформы отзывы пользователей и критиков. Постройте диаграмму рассеяния и посчитайте корреляцию между отзывами и продажами. Сформулируйте выводы. Соотнесите выводы с продажами игр на других платформах.

 Мы выяснили на шаге 3.3, что самой продаваемой платформой на 2016 год является PS4, её и будем рассматривать в данном вопросе.


```python
corr_PS4 = df[df.platform == 'PS4'][['sum_sales', 'critic_score', 'user_score']]
#строим матрицу корреляции
print(corr_PS4.corr())
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(corr_PS4, figsize=(10,10), s=80)
plt.show()
```

                  sum_sales  critic_score  user_score

На диаграмме видим зависимость общих продаж от оценки критиков, также это подтверждает корреляция 0.4, не сильно большая, но есть.
И по диаграмме и по корреляции видим, что оценка пользователей особо не влияет на продажи, что вызывает подозрения.
С одной стороны логично, чем выше оценка критика, тем больше пользователей захотят приобрести игру. Но с другой стороны оценка пользователей также должна иметь свой вес, чему мы не нашли явного подтверждения.

Для сравления посмотрим на матрицу корреляции для двух других самых продаваемых платформ.


```python
corr_XOne = df[df.platform == 'XOne'][['sum_sales', 'critic_score', 'user_score']]
print(corr_XOne.corr()) #строим матрицу корреляции для XOne
```

                  sum_sales  critic_score  user_score
    sum_sales      1.000000      0.416998   -0.068925
    critic_score   0.416998      1.000000    0.472462
    user_score    -0.068925      0.472462    1.000000



```python
corr_3DS = df[df.platform == '3DS'][['sum_sales', 'critic_score', 'user_score']]
print(corr_3DS.corr()) #строим матрицу корреляции 3DS
```

                  sum_sales  critic_score  user_score
    sum_sales      1.000000      0.320803    0.197583
    critic_score   0.320803      1.000000    0.722762
    user_score     0.197583      0.722762    1.000000


Для платформ XOne и 3DS также наблюдаем зависимость общих продаж от оценки критиков, примерно на одном уровне. Следует отметить, что для платформы 3DS замечается чуть большая зависимость от оценки пользователей, но все равно решающая.

### Посмотрите на общее распределение игр по жанрам. Что можно сказать о самых прибыльных жанрах? Выделяются ли жанры с высокими и низкими продажами?

По диаграмме видим, что приобладает жанр Action, Role-Playning, затем идут Adventure, Sports,  и Shooter.
 
Посмотрим на суммарные продажи по всем жанрам.

Для выявления наиболее прибыльного жанра проверим средние и медианные продажи для каждого и построим диаграмму.


```python
genre_sum_sales = df.pivot_table(index='genre', values='sum_sales', aggfunc=['mean']).reset_index()
genre_sum_sales.columns = ['genre','mean']
genre_sum_sales.sort_values('mean', ascending=False).head(10)
```

Распределение по продажам показывает, что игры жанра Shooter продаются лучше всего, в то время как он занимает пятое место среди общего распределения игр по жанрам. На втором месте появляется жанр Platform, который также среди общего распределения находится практически на последних местах. 

Sports идет на третьем месте практически также, как и в первой диаграмме. Соотношение общего количества игр к продажам вполне нормальное именно для этого жанра.

Не можем не отметить, разительную разницу между количеством игр жанра Action и его средними продажами. Можем предположить, что для этого жанра храктерно очень большое количество маленьких игр с низкими продажами.


### Вывод

Мы проанализировали количество выпускаемых игр по годам и заметили явную тенденцию роста начиная с 1994 года. Также прослеживается не менее резкий спад с 2010 года вплоть до 2012 года, после которого количество выпускаемых игр в год примерно на одном уровне. Столь резкое падение может быть обусловлено стремительным развитием мобильных приложений на платформах iOS и Android, а также некий переход на онлайн игры..

Также мы посмотрели, как менялись продажи по платформам и выбрали пять платформ с наибольшими суммарными продажами - PS4, PS3, X360, 3DS и XOne и постройли распределение по годам. Мы выяснили, что в среднем для каждой платформы характерно примерно 5 лет прибывания на рынке.

Еще мы выявили три платформы, которые лидируют по продажам - это PS4, XОne и 3DS. И построили график «ящик с усами» по глобальным продажам игр в разбивке по платформам. Это дало нам понять, что наибольшие медианные продажи у платформ X360 и PS3. 

Общее распределение игр по жанрам показало, что по количеству на рынке приобладает жанр  Action. Затем идут Role-Playning, Adventure, Sports, и Shooter. Однако, распределение по продажам показывает, что игры жанра Shooter продаются лучше всего, в то время как он занимает пятое место среди общего распределения игр по жанрам. На втором месте появляется жанр Platform. 
Sports идет на третьем месте по продажам, как и в общем распределении. Соотношение общего количества игр к продажам вполне нормальное именно для этого жанра.

## Составление портрета пользователя каждого региона

В этом разделе мы определим для пользователя каждого региона (NA, EU, JP):
 - Самые популярные платформы (топ-5)
 - Самые популярные жанры (топ-5)
 - Выясним, влияет ли рейтинг ESRB на продажи в отдельном регионе

**1. Самые популярные платформы (топ-5). Опишите различия в долях продаж.**


```python
top_platform_na_sales = df.groupby(['platform'])['na_sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head().reset_index()
#строим гистограмму Топ-5 самых популярных платформ в Америке
fig = px.histogram(top_platform_na_sales, x='platform', y='na_sales', color='platform')
fig.update_layout(
    title_text='Топ-5 платформ в Северной Америке', 
    xaxis_title_text='Платформы', 
    yaxis_title_text='Продажи'
)
```

В Америке самой популярной платформой является Х360, в то время как в Европе PS4. В целом видим одни и те же платформы, с небольшой разницей в продажах.
В Японии же самой популярной считается платформа 3DS, которая занимает 5-е место в Европе и Америке.  

Самые высокие продажи наблюдаются в Америке, где скорее всего более востребован рынок компьютерных игр. В Европе наблюдается некоторый спад количества продаж, в Японии же видим самую маленькую долю продаж, что может быть обусловлено наименьшим населением среди рассматриваемых регионов. 

**2. Самые популярные жанры (топ-5). Поясните разницу.**

Видим, что в Америке и Европе практически одинаковые интересы, касаемые жанров игр. У обоих на первом месте жанр Action, в то время как в Японии Action сместил жанр Role-Playing.

**3. Влияет ли рейтинг ESRB на продажи в отдельном регионе?**

Приведем описание рейтингов для удобства работы:
- EC («Early Childhood»)	«EC» («Early childhood») — «Для детей младшего возраста».
- E («Everyone») — «Для всех».
- E10+ («Everyone 10 and older») — «Для всех старше 10 лет».
- T («Teen») — «Подросткам».
- M («Mature»)- «От 17 лет».
- AO («Adults Only 18+») — «Только для взрослых».
- RP («Rating Pending») — «Рейтинг ожидается».
- K-A» («Kids to Adults»)— «Для детей и взрослых».


```python
rating_na_sales = df.groupby(['rating'])['na_sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head().reset_index()
#строим гистограмму для продаж в Америке с учетом рейтинга ESRB
fig = px.histogram(rating_na_sales, x='rating', y='na_sales', color='rating')
fig.update_layout(
    title_text='Рейтинг ESRB в Северной Америке', 
    xaxis_title_text='Платформы', 
    yaxis_title_text='Продажи'
)
```

Снова наблюдаем практически одинаковую картину для Америки и Европы. На первом месте игры с рейтингом «От 17 лет», далее «Для всех», на третьем месте появляются игры без рейтинга, затем «Для всех старше 10 лет» и «Подросткам». 

Видим, что в Японии на первом месте по продажам игры, для которых рейтинг не был обозначен, причем такие игры продаются в разы лучше остальных. На втором месте игры с рейтингом «Для всех», затем «Подросткам» и «От 17 лет».

### Вывод

На данном этапе мы составили Топ-5 самых популярных платформ и жанров для пользователей каждого региона (NA, EU, JP). В Северной Америке самой популярной платформой является Х360, в Европе - PS4, а в Японии 3DS. Также мы выяснили, что в Америке и Европе на первом месте по продажам находится жанр Action, а в Японии жанр Action сместил Role-Playing.

## Проверка гипотез

 Нам нужно проверить две гипотизы:
 - Средние пользовательские рейтинги платформ Xbox One и PC одинаковые;
 - Средние пользовательские рейтинги жанров Action (англ. «действие», экшен-игры) и Sports (англ. «спортивные соревнования») разные.
 

### Гипотеза №1

**Нулевая гипотеза** будет звучать так - Средние пользовательские рейтинги платформ Xbox One и PC одинаковые.

**Альтернативная** - Средние пользовательские рейтинги платформ Xbox One и PC различаются.

Зададим критический уровень статистической значимости alpha = .05


```python
sample_1 = df[df['platform']=='XOne']['user_score'].dropna() #делаем срез данных для XOne
sample_2 = df[df['platform']=='PC']['user_score'].dropna() #делаем срез данных для PC
```

Сделаем тест Левене для оценки равенства дисперсий.


```python
stat, p = levene(sample_1, sample_2)
print('p-значение: ', p)
```

    p-значение:  0.01251484281850554


Значение p по тесту Левене достаточно большое, можем считать дисперсии равными и не добавлять параметр equal_var = False.


```python
alpha = .05 #задаем критический уровень статистической значимости
results = st.ttest_ind(
    sample_1, 
    sample_2)

print('p-значение:', results.pvalue)

if (results.pvalue < alpha):
    print("Отвергаем нулевую гипотезу")
else:
    print("Не получилось отвергнуть нулевую гипотезу")
```

    p-значение: 0.5535080500643661
    Не получилось отвергнуть нулевую гипотезу


Для выбранного уровня значимости - Отвергаем нулевую гипотезу. Следовательно можно сделать вывод, что средние пользовательские рейтинги платформ Xbox One и PC различаются. Гипотеза не подтвердилилась. 

### Гипотеза №2

**Нулевая гипотеза** будет звучать так - Средние пользовательские рейтинги жанров Action (англ. «действие», экшен-игры) и Sports (англ. «спортивные соревнования») разные.

**Альтернативная** - Средние пользовательские рейтинги жанров Action (англ. «действие», экшен-игры) и Sports (англ. «спортивные соревнования») одинаковые.

Зададим критический уровень статистической значимости alpha = .05


```python
sample_3 = df[df['genre']=='Action']['user_score'].dropna() #делаем срез данных для жанра Action
sample_4 = df[df['genre']=='Sports']['user_score'].dropna() #делаем срез данных для жанра Sports
```

Сделаем тест Левене для оценки равенства дисперсий.


```python
stat, p = levene(sample_3, sample_4)
print('p-значение: ', p)
```

    p-значение:  1.3125789036876737e-05


Значение p по тесту Левене не большое, следовательно, будем считать дисперсии отличающимися. Добавим в тест значение equal_var = False


```python
alpha = .05 #задаем критический уровень статистической значимости
results = st.ttest_ind(
    sample_3, 
    sample_4,
    equal_var = False)

print('p-значение:', results.pvalue)

if (results.pvalue < alpha):
    print("Отвергаем нулевую гипотезу")
else:
    print("Не получилось отвергнуть нулевую гипотезу")
```

    p-значение: 4.24307776572644e-20
    Отвергаем нулевую гипотезу


Тест показал, что оценки пользователей игр жанров Action и Sports одинаковые. Вторая гипотеза также не подтвердилась.

## Общий вывод

В ходе этого анализа мы предобработали исходные данные -  исправили названия столбцов, удалили пропуски в столбцах name, genre и year_of_release, заполнили пропуски в столбце rating на "no_rating", преобразовали тип данных в столбцах user_score, critic_score и year_of_release, и добавили новый столбец sum_sales с суммарными продажами во всех регионах.

Мы проанализировали количество выпускаемых игр по годам и заметили явную тенденцию роста начиная с 1994 года. Также прослеживается не менее резкий спад с 2010 года вплоть до 2012 года, после которого количество выпускаемых игр в год примерно на одном уровне. Посмотрели, как менялись продажи по платформам и выбрали пять платформ с наибольшими суммарными продажами - PS4, PS3, X360, 3DS и XOne, постройли распределение по годам. Выяснили, что в среднем для каждой платформы характерно примерно 5 лет прибывания на рынке. Еще мы выявили три платформы, которые лидируют по продажам - это PS4, XОne и 3DS. Нашли платформы с наибольшими продажами - X360 и PS3. Построили распределение игр по жанрам, которое показало, что в играх приобладает жанр Action, затем идут Role-Playning, Adventure, Sports, и Shooter

Еще мы составили Топ-5 самых популярных платформ и жанров для пользователей каждого региона (NA, EU, JP). В Северной Америке самой популярной платформой является Х360, в Европе - PS4, а в Японии 3DS. Также мы выяснили, что в Америке и Европе на первом месте по продажам находится жанр Action, а в Японии жанр Action сместил Role-Playing. Также мы выяснили, что в Америке и Европе на первом месте игры с рейтингом «От 17 лет», далее «Для всех», на третьем месте появляются игры без рейтинга, затем «Для всех старше 10 лет» и «Подросткам». В Японии на первом месте по продажам игры, для которых рейтинг не был обозначен, причем такие игры продаются в разы лучше остальных. На втором месте игры с рейтингом «Для всех», затем «Подросткам» и «От 17 лет»

В завершении анализа мы проверили две гипотизы и сделали вывод, что средние пользовательские рейтинги платформ Xbox One и PC различаются, а средние пользовательские рейтинги жанров Action  и Sports одинаковые. 

В целом можем сказать, что определяющими успешность игры закономерностями можно назвать жанр, так как мы выявили несколько фаворитов, на которых в целом делится рынок игр, также можно ориентироваться на оценку критиков.
